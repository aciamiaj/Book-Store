# Book-Store

The Book Store application is a Java program that allows customers to purchase books and generates a bill based on their selections. The program provides a menu-driven interface for the user to choose from options such as purchasing a book, displaying the bill, or exiting the system.

How to Use
Open the Java file  in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor.

Locate the main method within the class and run the program.

The program will display a menu with the following options:

Purchase a Book

Exit
Enter the corresponding number to select an option.

If you choose option 1, you will be prompted to enter the details of the book you wish to purchase:

Enter the name of the book.
Enter the category of the book (Fiction or NonFiction).
The program will validate the category and create an instance of the appropriate book type (FictionBook or NonFictionBook) with the given details.

The book will be added to the customer's bill, and the program will return to the main menu.
